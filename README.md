## Description
An app which lets users ask bespoke resturant requests by using OpenAI. Users can ask more unique answers than normal search engines, such as:
- An affordable place for a date in London that has beautiful views
- A instgrammable spot in Edinburgh that is near Waverley train station
- A cheap and quick place to eat solo in Bristol.

This web app is built using Next.js (latest), and OpenAI (4.72.0).

## Future Plans
You can check out how I want to improve this app on it's [project page](https://github.com/users/serenainzani/projects/3).

## How to use this project

### Getting a reccomendation
You can type a request in the the search input, and you will be given 3 resturant reccomendations. Feel free to be creative in the requests, but do include the location/city.

### OpenAI API
The version I am hosting on vercel should work until 2025 (when the credits expire).

If you are running this project locally, remember to use your own API key to make requests to OpenAI (see [here to generate your own](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).

## Commands

### Install
```
npm i
```

### Run

5. How to Use the Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

6. Include Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.

Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

7. Add a License
For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.

The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/

Up to this point what we have covered are the minimum requirements for a good README. But you might also want to consider adding the following sections to make it more eye catching and interactive.

Additional README Sections
8. Badges
Badges aren't necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know that you know what you're doing.

Having this section can also be helpful to help link to important tools and also show some simple stats about your project like the number of forks, contributors, open issues etc...

Below is a screenshot from one of my projects that shows how you can make use of badges:

The good thing about this section is that it automatically updates it self.

Don't know where to get them from? Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. They have a ton of badges to help you get started. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

9. How to Contribute to the Project
This mostly will be useful if you are developing an open-source project that you will need other developers to contribute to. You will want to add guidelines to let them know how they can contribute to your project.

Also it is important to make sure that the licence you choose for an open-source projects is correct to avoid future conflicts. And adding contribution guidelines will play a big role.

Some of the most common guidelines include the Contributor Covenant and the Contributing guide. Thes docs will give you the help you need when setting rules for your project.

10. Include Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide code examples and how to run them.

This will help show that you are certain and confident that your project will work without any challenges, which will give other people confidence in it, too
